# NETPBM_EXAMPLES #

## Overview ##

This is intended as a collection of simple examples/tutorials using the libnetpbm library.

netpbm is a family of simple image formats; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format.

libnetpbm is an open source C library for manipulating them.

See http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/libnetpbm.html for more on libnetpbm

My motiviation is to learn more about image processing myself, and share this with others.

## Examples ##

Examples will be listed here as and when they are ready for public consumption. If you
notice a new subdirectory that isn't listed, then it's probably not ready!

-pbm_copy: reads an existing pbm file metadata, then copies the metadata and image data
to a new file. The point is to showcase the libnetpbm functions for reading and writing
pbm images. Yes, the end result is the same as doing 'cp file1.pbm to file2.pbm' :).
